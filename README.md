Statistics
==========

Simple project using common statistical calculations.

### Future fixes
Cohesion - computations and ResultValue? Merge?

## Google testability plugin
Fix maven whitelist so I can finally whitelist other classes (e.g. guava collections).

### Contributing
Use sonar, pit test and testability plugins to verify the code cleanliness.

### Build
Building is easy...

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

> Note: all contributed code must have passing tests via Maven
